## Reporting in jmeter

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/

- 500 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 35 And Total Concurrent API requested: 3000.
- 1000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 100 And Total Concurrent API requested: 6000.
- 1300 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 106 And Total Concurrent API requested: 7800.
- 1500 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 81 And Total Concurrent API requested: 9000.

While executed 1500 concurrent request, found  24 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.27%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 7800 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
